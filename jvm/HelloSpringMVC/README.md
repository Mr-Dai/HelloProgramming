# Spittr

An introduction project for learning SpringMVC. All the source code comes from Chapter 5 of [Spring in Action, 4th Edition](https://goo.gl/d26m6q),
provided with my comments for better understanding.

## Test Run

Execute command:

```
gradlew :hello.springmvc:appRun
```

from the root folder of this repo. The server should start up and can be accessed via [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

Currently, the server might failed or behave in unexpected way as repository interfaces in package `spittr.data` are no implemented. I shall see to implement them when I got the time to finish chapter 10 of the book.
